# aiohttp example

A simple demo showing form validation with cion, including error handling.

This example uses raw string formatting and in a real application it is heavily advised to use a templating engine like `Jinja2`.

# cion
This example follows the latest commit of cion, so there may be features that are not included in the latest release.
Installing the latest commit is as simple as running:
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/meizuflux/cion.git
```
